# Hugging Face Pre-trained Models Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various pre-trained models from Hugging Face for different text and media generation tasks. The primary focus is on leveraging state-of-the-art models to handle the following tasks:

- **Image-to-Text Generation**: Converting images into descriptive text using pre-trained models.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generating images from textual descriptions.
- **Text-to-Audio Generation**: Creating audio content from text inputs.
- **Speech Generation**: Converting text into natural-sounding speech.

## Overview

The code and experiments are organized in the `huggingface_textmodels.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Each section of the notebook demonstrates how to use a specific type of model, showcasing their capabilities and providing example outputs.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and install the required packages using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is not provided, you can manually install the necessary libraries such as `transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`, etc.

## Usage

1. **Image-to-Text Generation:**
   - This section demonstrates how to use pre-trained models to extract text from images.

2. **Text-to-Image Generation:**
   - Learn how to generate images based on textual descriptions using available models.

3. **Text-to-Audio Generation:**
   - Explore generating audio content from text.

4. **Speech Generation:**
   - Convert text into speech using relevant models.

   For detailed examples and code snippets, refer to the corresponding sections in the `huggingface_textmodels.ipynb` file.

## Example

An example of how to use the models is provided within the notebook. You can see how to load the model, process inputs, and generate outputs.
